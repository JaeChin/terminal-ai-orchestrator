# System Evolution

Analyze this session for improvement opportunities.

## Review

1. What issues occurred during implementation?
2. What caused them?
3. How can the system prevent them?

## Areas to Improve

Consider updates to:
- `claude.md` - Global rules
- `agents/*.md` - Agent system prompts
- `agents/router.md` - Routing logic
- `.claude/commands/*.md` - Workflow commands
- `reference/*.md` - Task-specific guidance

## Output

For each improvement:
1. Describe the problem
2. Propose specific text changes
3. Explain how this prevents recurrence

Ask for confirmation before modifying files.
